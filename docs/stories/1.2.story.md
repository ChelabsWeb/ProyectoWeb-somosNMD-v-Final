# Story 1.2: Foundational Loader UI

## Status: Completed

## Story
As a user,
I want to see a visually distinct and branded loader UI,
so that I feel immersed in the NMD experience from the first moment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `Loader` component is created in `packages/ui` that serves as the main container.
2. The `Loader` component includes three distinct visual elements: a "gate" or frame, a dynamic "logo" element, and a "status text" display.
3. All elements are styled using the cinematic palette defined in the Tailwind preset.
4. The `Loader` component is integrated into the `apps/web` home page and is displayed by default.
5. The component structure is responsive and functions correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- A shared Tailwind preset is available at `packages/config/tailwind-preset.ts`.
- `globals.css` in `apps/web` maps the cinematic palette to CSS variables.
- `packages/ui` is configured with Shadcn UI primitives.

### Component Specifications
- **`Loader`**: The main component, composed of `LoaderGate`, `LoaderLogo`, and `LoaderStatus`.
- **`LoaderGate`**: A container component that frames the viewport, creating a letterbox effect.
- **`LoaderLogo`**: A component for the NMD logo (static for now).
- **`LoaderStatus`**: A text component for loading messages.
- Components should be named in PascalCase (e.g., `LoaderGate`). [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

### File Locations
- Loader components should be created in `packages/ui/src`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md - interpretation, see Project Structure Notes]
- The main `Loader` component will be integrated into `apps/web/app/page.tsx`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

### Styling
- Components must be styled using the existing Tailwind CSS configuration and the cinematic color palette. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Testing Requirements
- A basic unit test should be created for the `Loader` component to verify it renders without crashing.
- Tests should be created using Vitest in a `*.test.ts` file colocated with the component. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Project Structure Notes
- The `source-tree.md` document suggests a `loader.tsx` file directly in `apps/web/components`. However, to promote reusability, the loader and its sub-components will be built in `packages/ui` and exported for use in `apps/web`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create Loader Components (AC: 1, 2)**
  - [x] Create `loader-gate.tsx` in `packages/ui/src`.
  - [x] Create `loader-logo.tsx` in `packages/ui/src`.
  - [x] Create `loader-status.tsx` in `packages/ui/src`.
  - [x] Create the main `loader.tsx` component in `packages/ui/src` that composes the other three.

- [x] **Task 2: Style Components (AC: 3)**
  - [x] Add Tailwind classes to `LoaderGate` to create the framing effect.
  - [x] Style `LoaderLogo` with the primary brand colors from the Tailwind preset.
  - [x] Style `LoaderStatus` with the appropriate typography from the Tailwind preset.

- [x] **Task 3: Integrate into Web App (AC: 4)**
  - [x] Export the `Loader` component from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.
  - [x] Import the `Loader` component into `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`.
  - [x] Replace the default Next.js boilerplate with the `Loader` component.

- [x] **Task 4: Ensure Responsiveness (AC: 5)**
  - [x] Add responsive prefixes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to Tailwind classes to adjust layout and sizing.
  - [x] Verify the layout on simulated mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

- [x] **Task 5: Add Unit Test (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Create `loader.test.ts` in `packages/ui/src`.
  - [x] Write a simple test to ensure the `Loader` component renders its main elements.
