# Checklist Results Report
- **Execution:** Architect checklist (comprehensive mode) completed 2024-06-04.
- **Section 1 Findings:** Architecture maps cleanly to PRD functional/non-functional requirements; however, note that future CMS or Spotify API needs would require extending data/API sections.
- **Section 2 Findings:** Documentation provides sufficient diagrams/component definitions; keep animation package boundaries explicit to prevent GSAP sprawl.
- **Section 3 Findings:** Tech stack decisions are specific and justified; ensure Supabase + Vercel Blob credentials are managed via IaC to avoid drift.
- **Section 4 Findings:** Frontend UX spec covers flows; handoff prompt embedded in this doc for frontend architect/dev.
- **Section 5 Findings:** Error handling/testing/security strategies are defined; revisit rate limiting and data retention policies once production traffic patterns emerge.
