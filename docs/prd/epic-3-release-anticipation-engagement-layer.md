# Epic 3 Release Anticipation & Engagement Layer

Goal: Deliver the “Midnight Is Close” teaser scene, collaboration/contact flows, and analytics enhancements so the site drives future-release hype and actionable conversions.

### Story 3.1 Teaser Scene with Typographic Zoom
As a motion art director,
I want the “Midnight’s too close...” section to feature a typographic zoom-out effect on scroll with a dynamic particle background,
so that the teaser feels immersive and builds anticipation.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Section includes responsive headline typography, supporting copy, and background effects (noise/distortion) aligned to creative references.
2: Layout supports future teaser variants (multiple releases) via data/config.
3: Reduced-motion mode swaps intense animations for subtle fades while retaining visual hierarchy.
4: Accessibility checks ensure text contrast meets AA and screen readers announce teaser context.

### Story 3.2 Distortion & Parallax Animation System
As an interaction engineer,
I want reusable GSAP/Three.js hooks for teaser distortions and parallax,
so that we can choreograph motion without duplicating code.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Animation system exposes configurable parameters (intensity, frequency, trigger thresholds) for designers to tweak.
2: Parallax responds to mouse/touch movement while remaining performant (>50fps) across target devices.
3: System auto-disables for reduced-motion or low-power mode, logging state for analytics.
4: Regression tests verify animations don’t conflict with previous sections (hero, gallery) when chained together.

### Story 3.3 Collaboration & Booking Pathways
As an industry scout,
I want a clear contact form or CTA sequence to request collaborations or bookings,
so that I can engage the collective without hunting through socials.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1: CTA buttons surface in hero, artist overlays, and teaser sections, all routing to a dedicated contact modal/section.
2: Form collects name, organization, contact info, inquiry type, and message; validations and success/failure states provided.
3: Submissions post to Vercel Function (or Supabase) with email notification to the collective; errors are logged and surfaced to the user gracefully.
4: Analytics track form opens, submissions, and drop-offs to measure conversion health.

### Story 3.4 Analytics & KPI Instrumentation Enhancements
As a product analyst,
I want enriched telemetry for the new interactions,
so that KPIs (Spotify clicks, previews, inquiries, teaser scroll depth) can be monitored in dashboards.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Events fire for teaser engagement (scroll completion, CTA clicks), audio preview interactions, and contact submissions with relevant metadata.
2: Events flow into Vercel Analytics plus the chosen product analytics tool (e.g., PostHog) with schema documented.
3: Privacy compliance review ensures opt-in requirements or notices are in place if capturing personal data.
4: Dashboard or report outline specifies how metrics map to the goals defined in the PRD (session length, conversions).

### Story 3.5 QA & Performance Hardening
As a release manager,
I want regression tests and monitoring for the new sections,
so that cinematic effects never compromise reliability.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Automated tests cover contact form happy/edge cases, teaser visibility, and audio preview guardrails.
2: Visual regression snapshots (Percy, Chromatic, or Playwright) capture loader, hero, gallery, music, and teaser scenes after animations settle.
3: Performance budgets for CPU/GPU/memory are defined and monitored via Lighthouse CI or WebPageTest; alerts trigger when thresholds exceed.
4: Launch checklist verifies reduced-motion, accessibility, and telemetry behavior post-deploy.
