# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Deliver a single immersive destination where fans and scouts can experience all 12 artists with cinematic storytelling and synchronized audio/visual cues.
- Increase Spotify follows, newsletter signups, and collaboration inquiries by guiding visitors through a cohesive, emotionally resonant journey.
- Showcase current and upcoming releases (e.g., “Junta”, “Midnight Is Close”) with interactive previews, tracklists, and teasers that build anticipation.
- Establish a maintainable, high-performance foundation (Next.js 16, GSAP, Three.js, Shadcn UI, Tailwind, Vercel) that can expand with future drops.
- Reinforce the collective’s brand identity by merging motion graphics, 3D logo work, and curated references (GTA VI, Travis Scott Utopia, Lando Norris).
- Introduce a merch shopping experience that converts fans directly within the cinematic journey while preserving performance and accessibility standards.

### Background Context
Project Web NMD responds to a fragmented digital presence where social snippets, isolated microsites, and individual portfolios fail to tell the collective’s story cohesively. Fans, collaborators, and industry scouts must stitch together who the 12 artists are and what they sound like, resulting in short sessions, weak brand perception, and missed opportunities. The new experience acts as a “living music video” landing page—opening with a Three.js logo loader, flowing into a GTA VI-inspired hero reveal, and continuing through horizontal artist galleries, music highlights, and teasers for upcoming releases. It must feel like entering a digital music video while still performing smoothly across modern web platforms.

### Research & Market Insights
- **Sources:** Moodboards and creative direction notes from the collective, existing group photo/portrait assets, release collateral for “Junta,” and reference studies of experiential sites (GTA VI, Travis Scott’s Utopia, Lando Norris). Conversations with the 12 artists highlighted the pain of scattered storytelling and inconsistent branding.
- **Competitive Signals:** Contemporary artist collectives increasingly launch immersive drop sites (e.g., OVO, 88rising). None blend cinematic 3D loaders, scroll masking, and synchronized previews the way Project Web NMD intends, providing differentiation through motion craft.
- **User Needs Recap:** Fans want a single immersive entry point with quick access to audio and visuals; industry scouts need professional summaries plus booking/contact flows; both groups cite frustration with hopping between socials.
- **Baseline Metrics (Current State):** No centralized site exists, so Spotify click-throughs, inquiry submissions, and session duration are effectively near-zero/unknown. Success metrics will therefore compare against post-launch baselines captured in analytics.
