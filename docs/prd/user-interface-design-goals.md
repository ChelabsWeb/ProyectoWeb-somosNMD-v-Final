# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A cinematic “living music video” journey: full-bleed visuals, synchronized motion/audio cues, and seamless scene transitions that feel like entering the collective’s digital world. Emphasis on drama (3D logo, theatrical lighting) balanced with a clean UI frame so content stays readable during motion-heavy sequences. _(Assumption: Visitors expect a premium, art-film aesthetic; no conflicting brand guidelines provided.)_

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Scroll-driven storytelling with GSAP timelines, including the GTA VI–style mask reveal and progressive scene changes.
- Horizontal drag/scroll galleries for artist exploration, augmented by subtle particle motion and depth parallax.
- Hover/tap-triggered audio snippets, with tactile feedback (glow, waveforms) signaling playback.
- CTA overlays and micro-transitions that guide users toward Spotify and inquiry actions without breaking immersion. _(Assumption: Touch gestures mimic mouse interactions; confirm if additional inputs like gyroscope are desired.)_

### Core Screens and Views
- Loader + hero reveal (3D logo → portrait with mask animation)
- Artist gallery with profile overlays
- Music projects grid/cards with audio previews and tracklists
- Upcoming release teaser scene (“Midnight Is Close”)
- Contact/inquiry overlay or section for collaboration requests _(Assumption: No dedicated blog/news screen for MVP.)_

### Accessibility: None
Currently assuming standard WCAG-aligned behaviors (reduced motion, keyboard support); confirm if AA compliance is required.

### Branding
- Neon-accented, dark cinematic palette inspired by GTA VI, Travis Scott Utopia, and Lando Norris references.
- Modern bold sans-serif type and motion graphics that echo music video titles.
- Use official group logo (SVG + 3D) plus existing portraits and album art as hero assets. _(Assumption: No formal brand book yet; palette/type finalized once design direction is set.)_

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Responsive experience that scales from large-screen hero scenes to mobile vertical scrolling, with shorter motion timelines on smaller devices.

### Primary User Flows & Edge Cases
1. **Cinematic Entry Flow:** Visitor lands on loader → hero mask reveal → navigation markers guide to artists or music sections; fallback path shows simplified fade when reduced-motion is enabled.
2. **Artist Deep Dive Flow:** From hero CTA or nav marker → horizontal gallery scroll/drag → select artist card → overlay with bio/socials/projects → optional outbound links (new tab). Edge cases: failed portrait load triggers placeholder state; overlay always provides close/back controls.
3. **Music Sampling Flow:** Scroll into music grid → expand album card → preview tracks via hover/tap → follow Spotify CTA. Edge cases: audio permission denied or snippet unavailable surfaces tooltip + disabled preview.
4. **Collaboration/Inquiry Flow:** CTA buttons (hero, overlays, teaser) → contact modal/section → submit form → success confirmation or inline validation errors. Error handling includes retry guidance and email fallback link.
5. **Release Teaser Flow:** Continue scroll → “Midnight Is Close” teaser with animated typography/distortion → optional countdown or “notify me” CTA → analytics log attention even if CTA untouched. Reduced-motion path swaps to subtle fades while preserving instructions.

Entry points include direct hero anchors or deep links from marketing campaigns; exit points include Spotify, social links, or the contact success state. Each flow logs analytics events to support KPI tracking.
