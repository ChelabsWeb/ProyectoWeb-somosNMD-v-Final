# Checklist Results Report
- **Execution:** Comprehensive PM checklist review completed 2024-06-03.
- **Section 1 – Problem Definition & Context:** Goals, problem framing, and KPIs are well documented (`docs/prd.md:5-37`), but there is no explicit summary of user research, competitive insights, or baseline metrics for Spotify/inquiry targets; add a short subsection capturing these sources/data points.
- **Section 2 – MVP Scope:** Functional scope is clear via FRs and epic descriptions, yet an explicit “Out of Scope / Future Enhancements” list and MVP test/learning plan are missing in this PRD draft (previously only in the brief). Recommend porting those details in so scope boundaries and validation approach are visible here.
- **Section 3 – User Experience Requirements:** UX vision and interaction paradigms are strong (`docs/prd.md:38-78`), but primary flows, entry/exit points, and error states are only implied—consider adding a brief flow diagram or narrative plus reduced-motion/accessibility notes for each major section.
- **Section 4 – Functional Requirements:** FRs and epic stories are testable and sequential (`docs/prd.md:23-240`). No blocking issues.
- **Section 5 – Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance/accessibility/analytics constraints are solid (`docs/prd.md:31-37`), but security/compliance specifics (data retention for contact form, authentication needs, privacy notice placement) are referenced only briefly; expand with explicit requirements in a Security subsection.
